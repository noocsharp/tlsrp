tlsrp
=====

tlsrp is a simple TLS reverse-proxy built on top of LibreSSL's libtls.

      ┌────────┐   Protocol   ┌───────┐   Protocol/TLS   ┌────────┐
      │ Server │ <==========> │ tlsrp │ <==============> │ Client │
      └────────┘              └───────┘                  └────────┘

A typical use case for tlsrp might be to turn a regular HTTP server into an
HTTPS server. However, it is protocol agnostic, so it can be used for putting
any TCP/IP protocol on top of a TLS layer. The server gets to serve the plain
protocol and the client receives the secured protocol.

Through its arguments, tlsrp can be configured to listen and serve over both
unix sockets and network sockets. The TLS parameters themselves can be
configured by modifying config.h. See the manpage for more details.
