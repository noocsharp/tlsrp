tlsrp
=====

tlsrp is a simple TLS reverse-proxy built on top of LibreSSL's libtls.

      ┌────────┐   Protocol   ┌───────┐   Protocol/TLS   ┌────────┐
      │ Server │ <==========> │ tlsrp │ <==============> │ Client │
      └────────┘              └───────┘                  └────────┘

A typical use case for tlsrp might be to turn a regular HTTP server into an
HTTPS server. However, it is protocol agnostic, so it can be used for putting
any TCP/IP protocol on top of a TLS layer. The server thinks its serving the
plain protocol and the client thinks its receiving the secured protocol.

Dependencies
------------
libtls from LibreSSL

Usage
-----
tlsrp [-h backhost] [-H fronthost] -p backport -P frontport -ca ca_path 
        -cert cert_path -key key_path

tlsrp -U unixsocket [-H fronthost] -P frontport -ca ca_path 
        -cert cert_path -key key_path

TODO
----
[ ] testing
[ ] verify compatibility with libtls-bearssl (https://sr.ht/~mcf/libtls-bearssl/)
